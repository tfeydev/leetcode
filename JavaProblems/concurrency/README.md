# 🧠 Concurrency and Multithreading
---

This directory focuses on challenges related to concurrent programming in Java. Solutions here demonstrate proper use of locks, synchronized blocks, atomic variables, and executors to solve problems in a thread-safe and efficient manner.

### Focus Areas

* **Synchronization Primitives:** Utilizing `synchronized`, `ReentrantLock`, and `Semaphore`.
* **Thread Safety:** Ensuring shared data is modified correctly in a multi-threaded environment.
* **Deadlock Avoidance:** Implementing patterns that prevent resource contention issues.
* **Producers/Consumers:** Implementing common concurrency patterns using Blocking Queues.

### Available Problems

| Problem | Focus Area | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[FooBar]** | Thread Synchronization (Semaphores) | To be implemented |
| **[Dining Philosophers]** | Deadlock Prevention | To be implemented |
