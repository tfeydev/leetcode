# 🧩 Algorithm Solutions
---

This directory contains solutions for traditional algorithmic challenges. Each problem is implemented in its own dedicated sub-module and includes performance runners for complexity verification.

Solutions are categorized by difficulty:

* **[easy/](./easy)**: Problems solvable with fundamental data structures and straightforward logic (e.g., Two Sum).
* **[medium/](./medium)**: Problems requiring moderate effort, often involving Dynamic Programming, Graph Traversal, or advanced tree structures.
* **[hard/](./hard)**: Complex challenges requiring deep theoretical knowledge, advanced optimization, or specialized algorithms.

### 📝 Documentation & Testing

Each problem module follows a standardized structure:
* `Solution.java`: Contains the primary algorithm implementation.
* `TwoSumPerformanceRunner.java`: JUnit test for benchmarking the time complexity ($O(N), O(N^2)$).
